# Automatic Irrigation System with Arduino Uno 🌿💧

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **automate plant irrigation** using a system based on the **Arduino Uno**. It addresses several key needs:

* 💧 **Optimize water usage** by irrigating only when the soil actually needs it.
* 🌱 **Keep plants healthy** by providing consistent and adequate moisture levels.
* 🔧 **Reduce manual intervention** in repetitive tasks, making it easier to care for home gardens or small-scale crops.
* ♻️ **Encourage responsible use of natural resources**, especially in urban settings or water-scarce areas.

## 🔧 Components Needed

To build this project with the Arduino Uno, you'll need the following materials:

* 1x Arduino Uno
* 2x Soil Moisture Sensors (each with its own controller)
* 1x Breadboard
* Jumper wires (male-to-male)
* 1x Potentiometer
* 1x RGB LED
* 1x Small water pump
* 1x Thin tubing
* 1x Solar panel
* Rechargeable batteries
* Lots of jumper wires
* Tons of creativity ✨

These components together allow you to create a dynamic and adaptable irrigation system that can be customized based on sunlight, soil dryness, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

Inside the folder `AutomaticIrrigation_ArduinoUno/`, you will find:

* `Code/`: Contains the `.ino` file with the source code.
* `Schematics/`: Diagrams showing how to connect the components.
* `README.md`: This document.

This project is a fun, practical, and creative way to learn about microcontrollers, electronics, and sustainability!
