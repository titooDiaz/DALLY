# DALLY
## Automatic Irrigation System 🌿💧

### Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **automate plant irrigation** using a system based on the **Arduino Uno**. It addresses several key needs:

* 💧 **Optimize water usage** by irrigating only when the soil actually needs it.
* 🌱 **Keep plants healthy** by providing consistent and adequate moisture levels.
* 🔧 **Reduce manual intervention** in repetitive tasks, making it easier to care for home gardens or small-scale crops.
* ♻️ **Encourage responsible use of natural resources**, especially in urban settings or water-scarce areas.

The system may include soil moisture sensors, a water pump or solenoid valve, and a basic control interface.

## Project Structure

Inside the main folder `DALLY`, you will find **all microcontroller-based projects**, organized by the type of hardware used.

For example:

```
DALLY/
├── ARDUINO UNO/
│   ├── main.ino
│   ├── README.md
├── AnotherProject/
```

Each subfolder within `DALLY` includes:

* Source code (`.ino`, `.py`, etc.)
* Circuit diagrams (PDF or image)
* Project-specific documentation
